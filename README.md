# C868
This covers the final course in WGU Software Development program C868 Capstone


Technical Specs: This is a revised version of the Project C195 it uses Java as the Programming language, SceneBuilder for the GUI elements, and MySQL for database storage.

Purpose of the project: The purpose of the project was to create an appointment scheduler application that will allow the user to add customer to the database, edit their information, or delete them from the database as well as add new appointments to the database, edit
exisiting appointments in the database, or delete appointments entirely. This application can also generate reports based off specific queries in the code, in the application there are currently 4 but can be changed to include more depending on the need. The 4 different 
reports that can be generated are the Total by Month, Total by Type, Contact Schedule, and Appointment by Country. This application is also protected by username and password protection, if the user does not enter the correct password or username they will not be able to
access the application. (Username and Passwords are in the SQL database in a table listed Users) The application also includes a login activity log that displays the login attempts, the dates they were attempted, the time zone, time and whether the attempt was a fail or not.
The thing that makes this project file different from the C195 is that this project includes search integration on the Customer and Appointment Sections of the application as well as it detects the default language of the users computer and changes all the GUI text to match
what they would be in the respective language. (The languages set up in the project currently are for English and for French).

All information for running the application are included in a README.txt in the project file
